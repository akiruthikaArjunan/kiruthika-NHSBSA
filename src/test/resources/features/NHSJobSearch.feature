Feature: NHS Job Search Functionality
  As a jobseeker on the NHS Jobs website
  I want to search for jobs using my preferences
  So that I can see relevant and recent job listings

  Background:
    Given I am on the NHS jobs search page

  @ui
  Scenario: Verify placeholder text and default dropdown values after expanding more search options
    When I click on the More search options link
    Then the What field should display hint text "For example, job title or skills"
    And the Distance dropdown should be disabled with "All locations" selected by default
    And the Pay Range dropdown should have "Please select" option selected by default
